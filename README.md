## About this repository
It contains the dataset [spam.csv](https://github.com/Deepanshuharsh2209/SMS_Spam_Classifier/blob/main/spam.csv) used for this project.

It contains a Jupyter notebook [ESC.ipynb](https://github.com/Deepanshuharsh2209/SMS_Spam_Classifier/blob/main/ESC.ipynb) where I have preprocessesd the data and developed the model.

It contains the website code in [app.py](https://github.com/Deepanshuharsh2209/SMS_Spam_Classifier/blob/main/app.py). I have used streamlit module of python to develop the website.

It contains the pickle files [vectorizer.pkl](https://github.com/Deepanshuharsh2209/SMS_Spam_Classifier/blob/main/vectorizer.pkl) and [model.pkl](https://github.com/Deepanshuharsh2209/SMS_Spam_Classifier/blob/main/model.pkl) generated from [ESC.ipynb](https://github.com/Deepanshuharsh2209/SMS_Spam_Classifier/blob/main/ESC.ipynb).

The vectorizer file contains the text vectorizer used (Tfidf Vectorizer) and the model file contains the final model used for prediction ie Naive Bayes (MultinomialNB).
